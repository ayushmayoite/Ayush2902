# Peak State Master Plan (CONSOLIDATED)

I have combined the **Vast Enhancement Plan**, the **Product Layout Plan**, and the **Root Consolidation Plan** into one definitive source of truth.

## 📍 Master Plan Location

The full technical and visual roadmap is now located at:
**[peak_state_master_plan.md](file:///e:/ourwebsite/.agent/plans/peak_state_master_plan.md)**

## 🛡️ Safety Enforcement

- **No Deletion Rule**: Codified in [safety_rules.md](file:///e:/ourwebsite/.agent/rules/safety_rules.md).
- **All Backups**: Stored in [e:\ourwebsite\backup/](file:///e:/ourwebsite/backup/).

## 🚀 Key Directives

1. **Hardware Acceleration**: GPU/NPU hints are mandatory for all `motion` components.
2. **Visual Vastness**: High-contrast, minimal, and spacious layouts.
3. **Pseudo-3D Engine**: CSS-powered rotation in the Configurator.
