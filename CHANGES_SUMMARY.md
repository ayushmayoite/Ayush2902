# Changes Summary

I fixed likely hang/memory-leak issues by adding proper cleanup for timers and event listeners.

## Updated Files

1. `components/configurator/ConfiguratorCSS.tsx`
- Replaced anonymous `mouseup` handler with a named `handleMouseUp`.
- Added `removeEventListener("mouseup", handleMouseUp)` in cleanup.
- Prevents leaked global mouse listeners while dragging.

2. `components/ai/Advisor.tsx`
- Added `focusTimeoutRef` for delayed focus timer.
- Clears previous/new timers on re-open/unmount.
- Prevents pending timer callbacks after close/unmount.

3. `components/layout/SearchOverlay.tsx`
- Added `focusTimeoutRef` and cleanup for delayed input focus.
- Avoids timer buildup during rapid open/close.

4. `components/home/HeroSlider.tsx`
- Added `transitionTimeoutRef` for slide transition timeout.
- Clears transition timeout in `goTo` and effect cleanup.
- Prevents overlapping delayed state updates.

5. `components/configurator/SummaryPanel.tsx`
- Added `copiedTimeoutRef` for "Copied!" reset timer.
- Clears previous timeout and unmount timeout.
- Prevents stale timeout updates.

6. `components/shared/GsapAnimations.tsx`
- Added guarded `isActive` flag and explicit listener cleanup array.
- Removes `load/error` listeners on route change/unmount.
- Prevents listener accumulation and stale `setState` calls.

7. `app/tracking/page.tsx`
- Added `trackTimeoutRef` for simulated API delay.
- Clears timeout before scheduling and on unmount.
- Prevents stale status updates after navigation.

## Verification
- Ran ESLint on touched files.
- Result: no errors, one existing warning (`setFrame` unused) in `ConfiguratorCSS.tsx`.

## Task1 Completion Log (2026-02-27)

1. Task1 execution checklist reviewed from `Task1.txt`.
2. Verified schema/task artifacts in repo:
- Migration present: `supabase/migrations/20260226_image_mapping.sql`.
- Script present: `scripts/002_image_mapping.sql`.
- Product category/slug page includes image fallback handling in `app/products/[category]/[slug]/page.tsx`.
3. Installed required project packages:
- Ran `npm install` (dependencies already up to date).
4. Installed missing deployment CLI:
- Ran `npm install --save-dev vercel`.
5. Ran production deploy verification command:
- `npx vercel --prod --yes`
- Result: blocked by invalid Vercel token (`vercel login` required).

## MAX/DWG to GLB Script (2026-02-27)

1. Added Blender conversion helper:
- `scripts/blender_to_glb.py`
- Converts `.fbx/.obj/.dxf` to `.glb`.

2. Added orchestrator pipeline script:
- `scripts/convert_max_dwg_glb.ps1`
- Supports input `.max`, `.dwg`, `.fbx`.
- `.max` route exports `.dwg` and `.fbx` via 3ds Max batch.
- Optional DWG route (`-PreferDwg`) uses ODA converter (`.dwg -> .dxf`) then Blender.
- Falls back to FBX route automatically if DWG route fails.
- Runs `gltfpack -cc` compression when available.

3. Rationale:
- Direct `.max -> .dwg -> .glb` conversion is tool/version sensitive.
- FBX fallback keeps conversion reliable for web delivery.

## Task 2 Completion Work (2026-02-27)

1. Rebuilt mismatch audit script:
- Updated `scripts/audit-mismatches.ts` with token-aware keyword checks to avoid false positives.
- Kept JSON table output at `scripts/audit-results.json`.

2. Executed Task 2 audit flow:
- Ran dry/fix/dry flow.
- Final result: `145` products scanned, `0` mismatches.

3. Updated alt generation integration:
- Replaced `app/api/generate-alt/route.ts` to use `gpt-4o-mini` when `OPENAI_API_KEY` exists.
- Added deterministic fallback alt text when AI key/service is unavailable.
- Reworked `scripts/batch_generate_alt.js` for AI + non-AI modes.

4. Validation:
- Ran `npx jest tests/images.test.ts -t "No chair image in tables category products" --runInBand`.
- Result: PASS.

5. Remaining blockers:
- Remote DB does not expose `alt_text` column yet.
- Vercel deploy still blocked by invalid token (`npx vercel login` required).

6. Follow-up after `local.env` service key update:
- Confirmed Supabase read/write access with service-role key from `local.env`.
- Re-ran `scripts/audit-mismatches.ts --fix`: still `0` mismatches.
- Re-ran `scripts/batch_generate_alt.js`: updated `145/145` products.
- Since `alt_text` column is absent remotely, alt text is stored in `metadata.ai_alt_text`.
